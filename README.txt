Spring Spiderweb

>An interactive OpenGL code example showing a single-threaded implementation of a spring-based spiderweb.
>You can click and drag the points around and see what happens (do not drag too far or the physics will break)
>We use Hooke's Law to simulate spring motion dynamics and we damp the movement with a float multiplication.
>We use point-mass kinematic bodies as well, that use RK4 integration to calculate their movement vectors.
